# Parcel-Tailwind CSS Starter

Use of this starter template assumes that you have a 'complete dev environment' setup - a terminal, Node, VS Code, at least. If not, you may want to [start here.](https://www.notion.so/codefinity/Setting-up-a-Local-Dev-Environment-for-JS-02a4e9f4a30043d3a8e7d109be3448f4)

## What's Included

- [![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- [![Code Style](https://badgen.net/badge/code%20style/airbnb/ff5a5f?icon=airbnb)](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). I've adjusted a few rules b/c those folks are just crazy 🤡 picky about some things that simply won't matter for smaller 'one off' apps like you and I would probably be making right about now!
- [`husky`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) will check over code quality with the linters b4 there is a successful `commit`.
- Various VS Code 'settings' and 'extensions.' Look in the bottom right when you open this up in VS Code to install them.
- For 'nice' fonts, I recommend using [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/).
- [Kite 🪁](https://www.kite.com/javascript/) is also included. I personally recommend it, but it's certainly not compulsory to set this up.
- [Parcel Bundler](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using the default config and PostCSS integration.
- Probably some other stuff I'm 4getting about for now 🤷🏽‍♂️

## How To Use

Run `npm i` to get all the things installed.

`npm run start` will 🔥 up `parcel index.html`. Go to 'index.js' and get that work! You'll probably want to start writing 'components.'📁

## 🎶

- I've included some other directories to encourage _modularity._ There are some comments and starter 🌱 code in each.
- There is no Stylelint included as the use of Tailwind CSS minimizes the need for Stylelint
